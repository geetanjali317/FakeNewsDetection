üìñ Project Overview

Fake news is a significant problem in today's digital age. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual data and identify characteristics of fake news.
Features:

    Text classification using machine learning algorithms.
    Preprocessing steps like tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
    Use of TF-IDF for feature extraction from text data.

üíª Technologies Used

    Python 3.12
    Libraries:
        Pandas
        NumPy
        Scikit-learn
        NLTK / spaCy
        Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
        TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional for deep learning-based models)

üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle Fake News Dataset.
Dataset Features:

    id: Unique identifier for the news article
    title: Title of the news article
    author: Author of the news article
    text: Main content of the news article
    label: 1 for fake news, 0 for real news

üß† Model Approach
1. Text Preprocessing

    Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.
    Stopword Removal: Removing common words like "the", "and", etc.
    Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").

2. Feature Extraction

    TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text into numerical features by considering the importance of words in the corpus.

3. Classification Models

The following machine learning models were trained and tested:

    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    Random Forest
    XGBoost

We also experimented with deep learning models like LSTM for sequence data processing.
‚öôÔ∏è Cross-Validation

Cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of various models on the dataset. This technique helps assess the generalization ability of the models by splitting the data into training and testing sets multiple times. The F1-score was used to compare the models' ability to balance precision and recall.

The models tested include:

    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    SVM
    Random Forest
    XGBoost

Cross-validation results were used to determine the best-performing model for fake news classification.
üõ† Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FakeNewsDetection.git  
cd FakeNewsDetection  

Install required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt  

    Ensure the dataset is placed in the data/ folder.

üöÄ Usage

    Preprocess the Data:
    Run the script to preprocess the dataset:

python preprocess.py  

Train the Model:
Use the training script to train a model:

python train_model.py --model <model_name>  

Make Predictions:
Predict whether news articles are fake or real:

    python predict.py --input test_data.csv --output predictions.csv  

    Interactive Notebook:
    Open FakeNewsDetection.ipynb to explore the data analysis, preprocessing, and model training steps interactively.

üìä Results

The best-performing model achieved:

    Accuracy: 99%
    Precision: 0.99
    Recall: 0.99
    F1-Score: 0.99

The Random Forest model, evaluated using cross-validation, outperformed other models in detecting fake news articles.
